A worried Sakura runs off to find Sasuke, only to be caught by Kakashi's genjutsu that made her believe she found a very injured Sasuke. This caused her to scream and faint. Once confronted by Kakashi, Sasuke forces Kakashi to stop reading Icha Icha and use both hands to defend against his string of taijutsu attacks. Sasuke then launches a giant fireball at Kakashi. The jōnin manages to avoid it by burring underground, before dragging Sasuke down, leaving only his head to be seen.",

Naruto expresses that he wants to go on a real mission that's exciting and challenging. Iruka lectures him, stating that like every beginner genin with no experience, he must start with simpler missions to develop his skills. The Third goes on to explain that with a higher-ranked mission comes higher difficulty and greater risk to the shinobi. However, Naruto exclaims that he is a ninja now and wants to be treated as such. Amused at his statement, the Third decides to give the team a C-rank mission to escort Tazuna, a master bridge builder, to the Land of Waves. When Tazuna meets the team, he expresses disbelief in the fact that kids are going to be guarding him but works with them nonetheless.",

Zabuza becomes agitated seeing his own techniques used against him, and Kakashi easily defeats him. Before Kakashi can deliver the finishing blow, Zabuza is seemingly killed by a young hunter-nin from Kirigakure. Naruto is angry and jealous that someone so young could easily defeat an opponent that gave Team 7 so much trouble, but Kakashi says that there are many ninja younger than Naruto yet stronger than himself.

When he wakes up, Kakashi realises that Zabuza's death had been odd, and concludes that it had probably been an act. Elsewhere, the hunter-nin, named Haku, revives Zabuza, revealing that he is in league with the missing-nin. Zabuza promises to crush Kakashi when they meet again. In the meantime, both Kakashi and Zabuza need to rest for at least a week to recover from their battle. To prepare for Zabuza's likely return, Kakashi takes Team 7 to the nearby woods for training, where they learn to walk up vertical surfaces using only their chakra. Sakura performs perfectly the first time, but Naruto and Sasuke require extra training. Kakashi notices that Naruto is finally getting a good grasp on teamwork, and recognises that Naruto's chakra is the highest of all those present.",
